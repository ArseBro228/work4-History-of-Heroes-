    <h2>What makes superheroes?</h2>
    <h4>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds</h4>

    <h2>What a person - Saitama?</h2>
    <h4>Saitama, (AKA Caped Baldy), is the titular ultimate main protagonist of the webcomic series/Manga/anime One Punch-Man, and the most powerful being ever alive in existence. Having apparently trained himself so hard that he unintentionally broke the natural limiter that prevents living beings from going beyond superhuman condition, Saitama faces an existential crisis as he is now too powerful to gain any thrill from his heroics.</h4>

    <h2>What a person - Naruto?</h2>
    <h4>Naruto Uzumaki is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned by most of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi, Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the while chasing his dream to become Hokage. </h4>
